<h1>10. Conclusion</h1>
<p>MCMC is a surprisingly difficult and bug-prone algorithm to implement by hand.
We find PyMC makes it much easier and less stressful. PyMC also makes our work
more dynamic; getting hand-coded MCMC&#8217;s working used to be so much work that we
were reluctant to change anything, but with PyMC changing models is much easier.</p>
<p>We welcome new contributors at all levels. If you would like to contribute new
code, improve documentation, share your results or provide ideas for new
features, please introduce yourself on our <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pymc&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">mailing list</a>. Our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki">wiki page</a><span class="link-target"> [https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/wiki]</span>.
also hosts a number of tutorials and examples from users that could give you
some ideas. We have taken great care to make the code easy to extend, whether
by adding new database backends, step methods or entirely new sampling
algorithms.</p>
